Reducing the parameters of the dataset
So in order to make the Project more user friendly, i am planning to reduce the parameters of the data
set by 12 for training and 10 for test, originally it had 23 and 21 for training and testing respectfully
I plan to do this by writing a python script which deletes the column values

encoder needs to be worked on
