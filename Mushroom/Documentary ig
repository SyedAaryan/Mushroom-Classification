Reducing the parameters of the dataset
So in order to make the Project more user friendly, i am planning to reduce the parameters of the data
set by 12 for training and 10 for test, originally it had 23 and 21 for training and testing respectfully
I plan to do this by writing a python script which deletes the column values

So the model now trains but Everything, the code i mean is of chat gpt, so i have no idea whats going
in, ill start the actual project from tom. Also by saying model tests, it doesnt test properly, ig the
encoder needs to be worked on

I was working on how to fix the encoder but i think i am going little advance early, i also came to realise
that the dataset i took had two dataset, Primary (which is named s mushroom_train.csv here) and Secondary
(mushroom_test_major.csv and mushroom_test_minor.csv)
Primary dataset has family, name, class but secondary dont, maybe i should learn using the secondary dataset
given before going to the primary

Yep, using the secondary dataset was easy, the test gives the accuracy of 97.6%
Although i still need to learn alot before going to the primary dataset
