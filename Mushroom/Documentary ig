Reducing the parameters of the dataset
So in order to make the Project more user friendly, i am planning to reduce the parameters of the data
set by 12 for training and 10 for test, originally it had 23 and 21 for training and testing respectfully
I plan to do this by writing a python script which deletes the column values

21/08/2024 : 20:00
So the model now trains but Everything, the code i mean is of chat gpt, so i have no idea whats going
in, ill start the actual project from tom. Also by saying model tests, it doesnt test properly, ig the
encoder needs to be worked on

22/08/2024 : 20:20
I was working on how to fix the encoder but i think i am going little advance early, i also came to realise
that the dataset i took had two dataset, Primary (which is named s mushroom_train.csv here) and Secondary
(mushroom_test_major.csv and mushroom_test_minor.csv)
Primary dataset has family, name, class but secondary dont, maybe i should learn using the secondary dataset
given before going to the primary

22/08/2024 : 20:50
Yep, using the secondary dataset was easy, the test gives the accuracy of 97.6%
Although i still need to learn alot before going to the primary dataset

Thanks to Aadhi (an idiotic friend of mine), i have found a way to deal with PrimaryDataset
Now
Amanita Family,Fly Agaric,p,[x; f],[g; h],[e; o],[y],[w],[u],[w],[t],[g; p]
This is an example of the dataset, as you can see, some parameters has 2 values inside one, [g; h], like
this, this can be solved by making g and h in a separate column
So ill be implementing it

24/08/2024 : 12:00
Primary data splitting has is done but its having an issue, since my primary data is less, it was having unSeen values
so i thought i will train using the Primary and Test Using Secondary, and it works, yes, but i cant check the accuracy
since family name and class are not present in the secondary
I have to write a decoder for the encoder it seems

24/08/2024 : 17:00
So i think the current encoder is having some issues, need to fix it
And since i am having multiple target values, i decided to move from DecisionTree to randomForest
But before that i will be working on the

31/08/2024 : 13:00
After taking a long break after so many things happening in my life, i am back to the project
Encoder and decoder is fine, so i was wrong about it ig, i checked the accuracy scores and it gives me 96% accuracy
I thought ill move to stage 2, where the model can take input from the user and predict the output
But  think i should refine the project more before moving to that stage, and to do list is also a mess
Before i move to stage 2, i will be working on the following:
1. Refine the project
2. Try to increase the accuracy
3. Add proper comments to the code

31/08/2024 :15:00
I tired Random Forest Classification, but it didnt gave me only 94% accuracy
So ill stick to Decision Tree Classifier and check for other modes

31/08/2024 : 16:00
I tired GBM and it gave me 81% accuracy, which is very bad compared to what i ws getting before
But idk if my tuning is not right or something else
As of now i will take a break in thi project (i just came back lol) and focus on a hackathon coming this week
Once that is done, i will come back to this project and try to increase the accuracy

01/09/2024 : 17:00
A devastating blow
I thought ill work on the project little, i moved to taking inputs from the user and the model predicted, but obiviously
it was wrong, the model NEEDS ALOT OF WORK, AND I MEAN ALOT
But thats not the issue, the issue that i believe the dataset itself is wrong
AN example of this is that According to the dataset i choose, Honey Fungus comes from tricholoma family, but in reality
it belongs to Armilliria family, which is not even present in the datasetand its a complete different family
So yea, i have to start from scratch and find a new dataset, amazing
