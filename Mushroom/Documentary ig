Reducing the parameters of the dataset
So in order to make the Project more user friendly, i am planning to reduce the parameters of the data set by 12 for
training and 9 for test, originally it had 23 and 20 for training and testing respectfully
I plan to do this by writing a python script which deletes the column values
